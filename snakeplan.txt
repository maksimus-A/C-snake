I am really stuck right now i have no idea what is involved
Okay umm
	- create border 
	- create "snake" character
	- randomly place "food" object
	- Somehow create game that runs at like "60 FPS" (sleep function probs)
	- Every, IDK, 15 frames(?), move snake 1 pixel (default right)
	- If, before next movement frame, key is input, change direction
	- After moving, check collision with wall, or food
	- If wall, end game, if food:
		- Figure out how to extend snake by 1 pixel
